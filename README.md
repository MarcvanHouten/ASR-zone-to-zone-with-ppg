# Azure Disaster Recovery between availability zones in a single region

Let's start with a disclaimer: Microsoft Azure services rapidly evolve so keep in mind that the information shared in this article can become outdated over time

This repository provides code examples how to implement Disaster Recovery(DR) of Azure Virtual Machines between availability zones in a single region based on [Azure Site Recovery (ASR) zone-to-zone](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/site-recovery/azure-to-azure-how-to-enable-zone-to-zone-disaster-recovery). 

The code examples shows how to setup the protection of a virtual machines, how to failover the virtual machine in case of an availability zone failure and how to re-protect the virtual machine after the failover so the virtual machine can failback to it's original availability zone when the failed availability zones has been restored. 

This example includes the use of [Proximity Placement Groups (PPG)](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/virtual-machines/co-location#using-proximity-placement-groups) to show that it's also possible to use this solution for virtual machines that require to be physically located as close as possible to each other. The virtual machine uses a static ip address to demonstrate that the virtual machines keeps the same ip address after the failover and failback and therefore it's also a suitable solution for applications that cannot handle a change of ip address during a DR situation.

All scripts in this repository are based on Powershell because at the time of writing this article PPG were only supported through Powershell. 

The re-protection script is using the ASR REST API because there is a bug (July 2020) in the Powershell cmdlet to configure the re-protection to the other zone correctly. CHECK 

This repository provides a couple of Powershell scripts:
1. a script that creates the test environment as a starting point (ASR_CreateTestEnvironment.ps1)
2. a script to configure the ASR protection of the virtual machine to another availability zone (ASR_protect.ps1)
3. a script to initiate a failover (ASR_failover.ps1)
4. a script to re-protect the virtual machine so it replicates back to the original zone (ASR_re-protect.ps1)
5. and a script to failback the virtual machine to its original zone and ppg (ASR_failback.ps1) 

**Notes**
1. Powershell cmdlets are changing over time. It could be that some of the commands will fail because of these changes. The scripts are tested with PowerShell version 7.1.0
2. This examples was tested in the West Europe region. Not all regions support ASR zone to zone yet. Please check the [link](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/site-recovery/azure-to-azure-how-to-enable-zone-to-zone-disaster-recovery) above to validate if your prefered region is supported.
3. Check if the VM you want to protect has resource locks enabled. If the source VM has resource locks remove these first before running the scripts. Otherwise the scripts will fail.
4. Be aware that the failover will use a differenct resource group. Currenty (Nov 2020) ASR doesn't support failover to the same resource group yet.   
5. Be carefull using the latest version of an marketplace image because the ASR agent doesn't support always the latest images. See https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/site-recovery/azure-to-azure-support-matrix to check if your image version is supported
6. The scripts are developed for test purposes only, do not use these in production environments.e.g. the script exposes a SSH port directly to the Internet. This not a recommended practice.

The following pictures shows the setup and use case the scripts provide.
